  - In Terminal, run:
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```

- **Explore VS Code Extensions**:
  - Consider adding extensions in VS Code for enhanced Python and Git support.


- **Install Xcode Command Line Tools** (if needed for Git):
